This program is designed to stream images from a camera, and detect
rectangles of a specified colour and aspect ratio sending the one
it finds to best fit the criteria given to a SmartDashboard plugin.
The SmartDashboard plugin serves only to relay the message to the
robot. Processing is handled by OpenCV, the code is written for
Unix systems but can, with very little effort, be ported to Windows.
The code was mostly hacked together with no prior knowledge of OpenCV,
so it's not the cleanest thing you're ever going to read.
